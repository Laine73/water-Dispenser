# water-Dispenser
Arduino code that uses an OLED, 5 pin rotary encoder, a relay module, and an 
arduino pro micro to turn an external water pump on for a specified amount of time based on how many ounces of water you want dispensed.

It's my first project non-breadboard projeceet and my way of figuring out Git and Github too.
